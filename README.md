## This is a SIMP module

This module is a component of the [System Integrity Management Platform](https://simp-project.com),
a compliance-management framework built on Puppet.

If you find any issues, they can be submitted to our [JIRA](https://simp-project.atlassian.net/).

Please read our [Contribution Guide](https://simp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contributors_guide/index.html).

## Description

This module provides an interface to the installation and management of ClamAV.

See [REFERENCE.md](./REFERENCE.md) for API documentation.

## This is a SIMP module

This module is a component of the [System Integrity Management Platform](https://simp-project.com),
a compliance-management framework built on Puppet.

If you find any issues, they can be submitted to our [JIRA](https://simp-project.atlassian.net/).

Please read our [Contribution Guide](https://simp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contributors_guide/index.html)

This module is optimally designed for use within a larger SIMP ecosystem, but
it can be used independently:

  * When included within the SIMP ecosystem, security compliance settings will
    be managed from the Puppet server.

  * If used independently, all SIMP-managed security subsystems are disabled by
    default and must be explicitly opted into by administrators.  Please review
    the `simp-simp_options` module for details.


## Using clamav

To configure ClamAV to install and run:

```puppet
include clamav
```

To remove clamav from the system, set the following via Hiera:

```yaml
---
clamav::enable: false
```

### Enabling updates

Generally, your updates will be provided by an upstream package repository,
such as EPEL. However, there are two optional methods for enabling DAT file
updates.

#### freshclam

To enable the `freshclam` update system, set the following via Hiera:

```yaml
---
clamav::enable_freshclam: true
```

NOTE: No additional configuration of `freshclam` is currently supported. To
update the configuration file, you will need to create your own `File`
resource.

#### rsync

You may choose to enable `rsync` downloads of the DAT files from a SIMP `rsync`
server. The module defaults are already set to support this configuration.

##### Client side

Add the following to Hiera to enable `rsync` downloads:

```yaml
---
clamav::enable_data_rsync: true
```

##### Server side

To add DAT files to the server, you should place them in
`/var/simp/environments/<environment>/rsync/Global/clamav` and ensure that the
permissions are set to `409:409`.


## Limitations

SIMP Puppet modules are generally intended for use on Red Hat Enterprise Linux
and compatible distributions, such as CentOS. Please see the [`metadata.json` file](./metadata.json)
for the most up-to-date list of supported operating systems, Puppet versions,
and module dependencies.


## Development

Please see the [SIMP Contribution Guidelines](https://simp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contributors_guide/index.html).


### Acceptance tests

This module includes [Beaker](https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker) acceptance
tests using the SIMP [Beaker Helpers](https://github.com/simp/rubygem-simp-beaker-helpers).
By default the tests use [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) with
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) as a back-end; Vagrant and VirtualBox
must both be installed to run these tests without modification. To execute the
tests run the following:

```shell
bundle install
bundle exec rake beaker:suites
```

Please refer to the [SIMP Beaker Helpers documentation](https://github.com/simp/rubygem-simp-beaker-helpers/blob/master/README.md)
for more information.

Some environment variables may be useful:

```shell
BEAKER_debug=true
BEAKER_provision=no
BEAKER_destroy=no
BEAKER_use_fixtures_dir_for_modules=yes
```

* `BEAKER_debug`: show the commands being run on the STU and their output.
* `BEAKER_destroy=no`: prevent the machine destruction after the tests finish so you can inspect the state.
* `BEAKER_provision=no`: prevent the machine from being recreated. This can save a lot of time while you're writing the tests.
* `BEAKER_use_fixtures_dir_for_modules=yes`: cause all module dependencies to be loaded from the `spec/fixtures/modules` directory, based on the contents of `.fixtures.yml`.  The contents of this directory are usually populated by `bundle exec rake spec_prep`.  This can be used to run acceptance tests to run on isolated networks.
